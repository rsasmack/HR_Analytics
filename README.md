# HR Analytics

HR analytics is a methodology for creating insights on how investments in human capital assets contribute to the success of four principal outcomes: (a) generating revenue, (b) minimizing expenses, (c) mitigating risks, and (d) executing strategic plans. HR analytics specifically deals with the metrics of the HR function, such as time to hire, training expense per employee, and time until promotion. All these metrics are managed exclusively by HR for HR. Recruiting and retaining quality employees is necessary for the success of both small and large businesses. One way to keep an employee is to regularly hold an employee promotion evaluation and let staff know the criteria for promotion. Establishing clear expectations for staff promotion is essential to motivate workers to give their best on the job every day.

Based on the current dataset our aim is to predict the promotion for employees and to classify the employees based on their performance with the given attributes.
